# VoxelSMP

## What's this

Handful of utils for me to use in the smp

## How to use this?

There's no docs because it's for the smp's internal use, however here are the commands:

- `/settings` - Opens the settings menu (Does not work, allowing players to dupe glass lmao)
- `/graceperiod <time> (/gp <time>)` - Sets the grace period for the smp
- `/autorestart <time>` - Sets the time for the server to restart
- `/deferrestart` - Defers the restart until everyone has left the server

## Can I join the smp?

You can join the smp by joining the discord server [here](https://discord.gg/yFt4XgjmCu)
